# Example Virtual N5

Example service showing how to host a virtual N5,
suitable for browsing in neuroglancer.

Neuroglancer is capable of browsing N5 files, as long as you store them on
disk and then host those files over http (with a CORS-friendly http server).
But what if your data doesn't exist on disk yet?

This server hosts a "virtual" N5.  Nothing is stored on disk,
but neuroglancer doesn't need to know that.  This server provides the
necessary attributes.json files and chunk files on-demand, in the
"locations" (url patterns) that neuroglancer expects.

For simplicity, this file uses Flask. In a production system,
you'd probably want to use something snazzier, like FastAPI.

To run the example, install a few dependencies:

    conda create -n example-virtual-n5 -c conda-forge zarr flask flask-cors
    conda activate example-virtual-n5

Then just execute the file:

    python example_virtual_n5.py

Or, for better performance, use a proper http server:

    conda install -c conda-forge gunicorn
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 8 --threads 1 example_virtual_n5:app

You can browse the data in neuroglancer after configuring the viewer with the appropriate layer [settings][1].
